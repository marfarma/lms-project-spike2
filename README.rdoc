spike for new project - with Devise OAuth and RSpec, and Rails_Admin (installed but not used yet)
Custom session controller, layout and integration specs are modeled after the style of the RailsTutorial 
project http://railstutorial.org, where it is recommended that views be tested together with controllers.

Based on the template project ==> Rails3 Omniauth-Devise supercombo, https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-subdomain-devise.git
